### Synopsis

```
For example, if you wanted to bring a Solana NFT over to Ethereum to sell it on OpenSea, the bridge would first lock the original NFT asset within the Wormhole smart contract on Solana.   
...   
Rather than literally transfer the asset from Solana to Ethereum, the NFT is frozen within the smart contract and then a new version is minted on Ethereum. The resulting ERC-721 NFT asset can be used and transferred like any native Ethereum NFT, and you can always bridge it back to Solana to release the original version from the smart contract.
