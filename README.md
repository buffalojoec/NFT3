# NFT3

Currently on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, NFTs exist on specific chains. Most notably, you can buy **Solana NFTs** on **Solana** and you can buy **Ethereum NFTs** on **Ethereum**, but you can't have both.   

#### *Now you can.*

NFT3 is a dApp that can operate as a standalone API or integrate into your NFT marketplace to allow your users to buy NFTs on any chain and buy/sell them cross-chain with ease.
